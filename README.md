In this project, I will work on some methods to deal with imbalanced dataset. 
Imbalanced dataset causes a lot of trouble for any predictive classifier. Usually in imbalanced dataset, the ratio of minority class is 1:10, which means that among one minority calss will be other 100 cases in majority class. This usually happens in the real-business problem, such as fraud event or spam email.
