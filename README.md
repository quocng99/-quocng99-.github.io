Imbalanced dataset causes a lot of trouble for any predictive classifier. Usually in imbalanced dataset, the ratio of minority class is 1:10, which means that among one minority calss will be other 100 cases in majority class. This usually happens in the real-business problem, such as fraud event or spam email.

For financial company example, one event of fraud can cause an adverse effect on company's revenue. Therefore, the strategy of some companies is to predict more customers as fraudulent even they are actual not the fraud in order to prevent more fraud as possible. 

Hence, in this project, I will deal with the imbalanced dataset problem with some technique such as Undersampling, Oversampling and SMOTE. Moreover, at the end, I also propose the way not to use these technique since sampling dataset can distort the nature of our dataset.
